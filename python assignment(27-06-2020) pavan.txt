1.   Write a python program to read an entire text file
 
ans:-def file_read(fname):
        txt = open(fname)
        print(txt.read())

file_read('test.txt')

2.write an python program to append text to a file  and display the text.

ans:-def file_read(fname):
        from itertools import islice
        with open(fname, "w") as myfile:
                myfile.write("Python Exercises\n")
                myfile.write("Java Exercises")
        txt = open(fname)
        print(txt.read())
file_read('abc.txt')

3.write a python program to read a file line by line store  it into a variable.

ans:-def file_read(fname):
        with open (fname, "r") as myfile:
                data=myfile.readlines()
                print(data)
file_read('test.txt')

4. write a python program  to read contents of a file using for loop.

ans:-with open("hello.txt") as f:
    with open("copy.txt", "w") as f1:
        for line in f:
            f1.write(line)
5.write a python program to remove  leading traling spaces from a string.

ans:-# Python code to remove leading & trailing spaces
# An example of string.strip() function)

# defining string 
str_var = "    Hello world   "

#printing actual string
print "Actual string is:\n", str_var

# printing string without
# leading & trailing spaces
print "String w/o spaces is:\n", str_var.strip()
